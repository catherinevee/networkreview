Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) Platforms
=====================================================

This document provides a comprehensive overview of SD-WAN technology, architecture, operation, and major platforms. SD-WAN represents a paradigm shift in WAN connectivity by separating the control plane from the data plane and providing centralized management of distributed network infrastructure.

What is SD-WAN?
---------------

SD-WAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Network) is an application of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) principles to WAN connections. It abstracts, virtualizes, and orchestrates WAN connectivity to provide:

- Centralized management and orchestration
- Dynamic path selection based on application needs
- Multiple transport options (MPLS, broadband, LTE, 5G)
- Application-aware routing
- Enhanced security
- Simplified operations
- Cost optimization

Traditional WAN vs SD-WAN
--------------------------

### Traditional WAN Architecture

Challenges:
- MPLS-centric, expensive circuits
- Static routing, manual configuration
- Backhauling Internet traffic through data center
- Complex management of distributed sites
- Slow deployment (weeks/months)
- Limited visibility into application performance
- No built-in security for Internet traffic

Typical Setup:
1. Primary link: MPLS circuit (expensive, reliable)
2. Backup link: Broadband (cheaper, used only on failure)
3. Hub-and-spoke topology
4. Branch traffic backhauled to headquarters
5. Manual failover configuration

### SD-WAN Architecture

How SD-WAN Works
----------------

### 1. Overlay Network Architecture

SD-WAN creates an overlay network on top of existing underlay transport:

Underlay Transport:
- Physical connectivity (MPLS, Internet, LTE, 5G)
- Multiple ISPs and circuit types
- Legacy WAN infrastructure

Overlay Network:
- Virtual tunnels between SD-WAN devices
- Encrypted tunnels (IPsec, proprietary protocols)
- Logical topology independent of physical
- Dynamic tunnel establishment and teardown

Example Overlay Tunnel Types:
- IPsec tunnels over Internet
- GRE tunnels
- VXLAN encapsulation
- Proprietary protocols (Cisco vPath, VMware VeloCloud VCMP)

### 2. Control Plane and Data Plane Separation

Control Plane:
- Centralized in SD-WAN controller
- Makes routing decisions and policies
- Distributes policies to edge devices
- Monitors network health
- Orchestrates tunnel creation

Data Plane:
- Distributed in SD-WAN edge devices
- Forwards packets based on policies
- Performs application identification
- Executes QoS and security policies
- Monitors link quality in real-time

Communication:
- Edge devices communicate with controller via secure control channel
- Controller pushes policies to edge devices
- Edge devices send telemetry back to controller
- Data plane traffic flows directly between edge devices (not through controller)

### 3. Application-Aware Routing

SD-WAN identifies applications and routes them based on policies:

Application Identification:
- Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)
- Port and protocol analysis
- DNS-based identification
- URL categorization
- SSL/TLS inspection
- Machine learning classification

Routing Decisions Based On:
- Application type (SaaS, VoIP, video, data)
- Business importance (critical, high, normal, low)
- Link characteristics (latency, jitter, loss, bandwidth)
- Cost considerations
- Security requirements
- Time of day

Example Policy:
- Voice (VoIP): Route over MPLS (low latency, low jitter)
- Office 365: Direct Internet breakout at branch
- SAP/ERP: Route over MPLS with backup to Internet
- Guest traffic: Internet only, no corporate access
- Video conferencing: Best available path based on real-time quality

### 4. Dynamic Path Selection

SD-WAN continuously monitors link quality and selects best path:

Monitored Metrics:
- Latency (round-trip time)
- Jitter (latency variation)
- Packet loss percentage
- Bandwidth utilization
- MOS (Mean Opinion Score) for voice
- Link availability

Path Selection Methods:
- Active/active: Load balance across multiple links
- Active/standby: Primary link with automatic failover
- Policy-based: Route based on application requirements
- Least-cost routing: Prefer cheaper links when performance adequate

Dynamic Behavior:
1. Edge device continuously probes all available links
2. Measures latency, jitter, loss every 1-10 seconds
3. Compares measurements against application SLA requirements
4. Dynamically switches flows to better path if needed
5. Can switch mid-flow without breaking TCP connections
6. Automatically fails back when conditions improve

Example Scenario:
- Branch has MPLS (10 Mbps, $1000/month) and Internet (100 Mbps, $100/month)
- Normal operation: Send critical apps over MPLS, bulk data over Internet
- MPLS congestion detected: Shift critical apps to Internet temporarily
- Internet link fails: All traffic fails over to MPLS
- Internet recovers: Traffic rebalances based on policy

### 5. Zero-Touch Provisioning (ZTP)

SD-WAN simplifies deployment of new sites:

Traditional Process:
1. Ship device to branch
2. IT staff configures device manually
3. Coordinate with carrier for circuit activation
4. Configure routing protocols, VPN, firewall
5. Test connectivity
6. Time: Days to weeks

SD-WAN ZTP Process:
1. Ship pre-staged device to branch
2. Non-technical staff plugs in device
3. Device discovers controller (via cloud redirection service)
4. Device downloads configuration from controller
5. Tunnels automatically establish
6. Site is operational
7. Time: Minutes to hours

ZTP Flow:
1. Device powers on, obtains IP via DHCP
2. Device contacts cloud redirect service (e.g., pnpserver.cisco.com)
3. Redirect service provides controller IP address
4. Device contacts controller with serial number/certificate
5. Controller authenticates device
6. Controller pushes configuration to device
7. Device applies configuration and establishes tunnels
8. Device reports operational status to controller

### 6. Traffic Engineering and QoS

SD-WAN implements sophisticated traffic management:

Traffic Classification:
- Identify applications using DPI
- Classify into traffic classes (voice, video, critical-data, bulk)
- Assign DSCP markings

QoS Mechanisms:
- Priority queuing for latency-sensitive traffic
- Bandwidth reservation for critical applications
- Rate limiting for low-priority traffic
- Traffic shaping to avoid congestion
- Forward Error Correction (FEC) for packet loss mitigation

End-to-End QoS:
1. Branch edge device classifies traffic
2. Marks packets with appropriate DSCP
3. Queues packets based on priority
4. Shapes traffic to avoid congestion
5. WAN link preserves QoS markings
6. Hub/gateway device honors QoS markings
7. Traffic delivered with appropriate priority

SD-WAN Security
